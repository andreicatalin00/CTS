1. The class should be included in a package;
2. The 2nd line has extra white spaces;
3. The attributes have inconsistent naming types: CamelCase and with -;
4. On line 30 the toString method should be overwritten using override;
5. Line 33 has extra spacing;
6. Line 35, random variable is assigned but never used;
7. Line 40 has extra spacing;
8. Line 45 has no space between the = sign;
9. Line 46 no spacing;
10. Line 47 has no spacing and the comments are placed in a weird possition;
11. In the constructor the value validation should be done in a separate setValue method;
12. Line 58 its better to use this.loan_value to make it clear that loan_value is an attribute of the Old_Account class;
13. The attributes should be private and accessed through getters and setters;

Solution:
1. We create packages;
2. We create an interface for the Old_Account class
3. We write the interface
4. We write the class:
    4.1. We define the attributes using camelCase
    4.2. We override the toString method
    4.3. We write the account type as an enum
